# 🏨 Hotel Business: Understand and Improve Revenue  
## Milestone 2 – Power BI Analysis

## Overview
Milestone 2 extends the Power BI data model created in Milestone 1 to analyze hotel occupancy, revenue performance, and guest behavior. The dashboard uses DAX-based calculations and interactive visuals to present key business metrics related to room utilization, pricing, booking channels, and guest segments.

## Objectives
- Implement occupancy and revenue-related KPIs using DAX
- Analyze booking and revenue trends over time
- Compare Direct and OTA booking channels
- Analyze guest segments and their revenue contribution
- Build an interactive and well-structured Power BI dashboard

## Key Metrics Implemented
**Occupancy %**  
Represents the percentage of rooms occupied during a given period.  

**Average Daily Rate (ADR)**  
Measures the average revenue earned per booked room.  

**Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**  
Evaluates overall room revenue performance by combining pricing and occupancy.  

All above metrics are calculated using DAX measures in Power BI.

## Analysis Performed
- Occupancy %, ADR, and RevPAR trend analysis by date
- Total revenue analysis by month
- Seasonal revenue comparison
- Booking source comparison (Direct vs OTA)
- Revenue contribution by guest segment
- Guest analysis based on country

## Guest Segmentation
Guests are categorized into the following segments based on booking and revenue characteristics:
- **First-time Guests**
- **High Spenders**

These segments are used to analyze revenue contribution across different guest types.

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards displaying Occupancy %, ADR, and RevPAR
- Line charts for time-based revenue trends
- Booking source comparison visual
- Guest segment revenue analysis
- Interactive slicers for:
  - Room Category
  - Hotel Branch
